# Comenteer

Comenteer is a simple Web application coded fully and solely by me. The design is _not_ mine.  
All design credits go to [Reactor Studio](https://www.reactor.studio/).

# Description

### What is Comenteer

Comenteer is a Web application that renders a comment section simulation. It allows you to browse comments, post your own comments or reply to already posted comments.

### Technologies used

The project was created with **Vite**.  
To build this project I used **React** with **TypeScript**. For styling I used **Sass**.

### Project structure approach

I structured the application in various directories each for their own purpose.

Assets directory holds elements that were necessary to build the application such as styling variables, icons used throughout the project and fake user data for the first render of the application.  
Components directory holds different components used throughout the application.  
Context directory holds the UserContext file that was used so that at the start of the application, the user can choose their own username, and that username will then be stored inside of React Context so it can be used later in the application.  
Helpers directory holds different methods that were used in the application.  
Pages directory holds different pages that render inside of the application.  
Types directory holds all interfaces that were used for props inside of the application.
